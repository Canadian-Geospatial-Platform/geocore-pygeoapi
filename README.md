# geocore-pygeoapi
A pygeoapi provider for CGP's geoCore Metadata API. 

# Use case and components
[Pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io) is a python based server implementation of the OGC API suite of standards. This module adds the capability to interact with the [CGP GeoCore Metadata API](https://github.com/Canadian-Geospatial-Platform/CGP_METADATA_API), which offers access to a variety of metadata records. The geocore-pygeoapi provider is set up as a python project, having the core pygeoapi project as a dependency. This means that pygeoapi is deployed as part of the install of the geocore-pygeoapi provider project. 

# Versioning of the geocore-pygeoapi provider
Feature development takes place in the master branch. As soon as we have a stable version a tag 0.x will be placed which can be used for production deployments, until a next release is made available. Any version released would benefit from referencing a fixed pygeoapi release. In the geocare-pygeoapi master branch a reference is made to the master branch of pygeoapi (requirements.txt) 

# Deploy and run a master branch
To run locally (or remote) the master branch, it requires some specific steps. Setup.py doesnâ€™t like the github syntax in requirements.txt, so you have to deactivate line 90 (install_requires) in setup.py and deploy requirements.txt manually. Then navigate to src/pygeoapi and run pygeoapi installation in that folder manually.
